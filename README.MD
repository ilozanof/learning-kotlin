# Kotlin Learning Project
This project collects a series of small examples, to show how _Kotlin_ can be used and how it can interoperate with _Java_.

The Book _Kotlin in Action_ has been used as a reference for the examples, and the packages structure reflects the chapters in the book.

## package structure and content

(The base package is _com.ilozanof.kotlin.learning_. All the packages contain a _package-info.java_ with a description of the content, and the order on which you should follow the examples.)

 * **basic:**
   Basic use of _Kotlin_: Variables declaration, functions, Exceptions, loops, etc.
   
 * **functions:**
   Definition of functions: with or without a returning value, extended functions, extended properties, interoperability Java-Kotlin, working with Collections and Strings, varargs, infix calls, destructuring declarations, etc.
   
 * **classes:**
   Classes and interfaces. how to define constructors, inner classes and extend Classes/interfaces. How to make use of Kotlin features to implements some design patterns, using the "by" or "object" keywords. How to implement universal methods (toSting, hashCode, equals)
   
 * **lambdas:**
   Examples of the use of Lambda Expressions in Kotlin.
 
 * **types:**
   Examples of use of different types in Kotlin, how to handle Nullability and Late Init Properties.
   
 * **overloading:**
   Examples of overloading operators, desestructuring declarations and Delegated properties.
   
 * **HighOrderFunctions:**
   Examples of passing functions as a parameters, and how to use local-returns and no-local returns and anonymous functions in lambdas.
